## **Why Do Arrays in C Start at 0?**  

Arrays in C start at `0` because:  

- **Simplifies memory address calculations** – avoids extra subtraction in address computation.  
- **Aligns naturally with pointer arithmetic** – `arr[i] == *(arr + i)`, making element access efficient.  
- **Makes loops and indexing more efficient**, reducing unnecessary computations.
