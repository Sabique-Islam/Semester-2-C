## Compile Time Initialization in C

### Definition
Compile-time initialization in C refers to the process of assigning values to variables, arrays, or structures at the time of declaration itself. This means that the values are assigned before the program is executed, and they are stored in the program's binary.

### Purpose
- Improves execution speed as values are preloaded.
- Reduces runtime overhead.
- Ensures fixed values are available at the start of execution.

### Example: Compile-Time Initialization of a C Array

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    // Compile-time initialization of an integer array
    int numbers[5] = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50};
    
    // Printing the array elements
    for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
        printf("numbers[%d] = %d\n", i, numbers[i]);
    }
    
    return 0;
}
```

### Key Features
- The array `numbers` is initialized at compile-time with values `{10, 20, 30, 40, 50}`.
- No need for runtime assignment using loops or manual input.
- Ensures that values are preloaded and readily available.

### Alternative Example: Character Array
```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    // Compile-time initialization of a character array (string)
    char name[] = "Hello";
    
    // Printing the string
    printf("%s\n", name);
    
    return 0;
}
```

### Summary
Compile-time initialization in C allows arrays to be pre-populated with values before execution, improving efficiency and reducing runtime processing. It is widely used for defining constant values and default data structures.
