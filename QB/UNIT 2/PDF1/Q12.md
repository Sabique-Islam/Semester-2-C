## Justification: C Compiler Never Checks Array Index Out of Bound

### The C compiler does not perform runtime bounds checking for arrays. This behavior is due to the following reasons:

- **Performance Optimization**: C is designed for efficiency, and adding bounds checking would introduce additional overhead.

- **Direct Memory Access**: C allows direct memory manipulation, giving the programmer control but also responsibility for handling array bounds.

- **Pointer Arithmetic**: Since arrays in C are closely tied to pointers, index validation would interfere with pointer operations.

- **No Built-in Safety Mechanisms**: Unlike higher-level languages like Python or Java, C does not include built-in mechanisms to detect out-of-bounds access at runtime.
