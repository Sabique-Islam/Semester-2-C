## **What is an Array Index Out of Bound Error?**
An **array index out of bound error** occurs when a program tries to access an array element using an index that is outside the valid range (0 to size-1). Since C does not perform **automatic bounds checking**, accessing an out-of-bounds index can lead to **undefined behavior**, including incorrect values, crashes, or memory corruption.

### **Example of an Out of Bound Error**:
```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int numbers[5] = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50};

    // Attempting to access an out-of-bounds index
    printf("Out of bound access: %d\n", numbers[10]);

    return 0;
}
```
**Potential Issues:**
- It may print **garbage values** or crash the program.
- It can cause **memory corruption**, leading to unpredictable behavior.

### **How to Prevent This Error?**
- Always ensure that loop counters and indices remain **within the valid range**.
- Use `sizeof(array)/sizeof(array[0])` to determine the array size dynamically.
- Consider using **boundary checks** before accessing elements.
