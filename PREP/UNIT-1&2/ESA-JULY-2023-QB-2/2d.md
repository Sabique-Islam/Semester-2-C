# Differences Between Arrays and Pointers

| **Aspect**              | **Array**                                                  | **Pointer**                                              |
|-------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| **Memory Allocation**    | Arrays have fixed size, and memory is allocated statically. | Pointers can point to dynamically allocated memory.      |
| **Size**                 | The size of an array is fixed and known at compile-time.   | The size of the memory block a pointer points to is dynamic. |
| **Access**               | Array elements are accessed using indices (e.g., `arr[0]`).| Pointer can access memory directly using dereferencing (e.g., `*ptr`). |
| **Reassigning**          | Arrays cannot be reassigned to point to another array after declaration. | Pointers can be reassigned to point to different memory addresses. |
| **Memory Address**       | An array name represents the address of its first element. | A pointer holds the address of any variable or memory location. |
| **Type**                 | An array is a collection of elements of the same data type. | A pointer stores the address of a variable of a specific type. |
| **Increment/Decrement**  | Array name cannot be incremented or decremented.           | Pointers can be incremented or decremented to point to different memory locations. |
| **Initialization**       | Arrays are initialized using braces `{}`.                  | Pointers are initialized using the address-of operator `&`. |
| **Comparison**           | Arrays cannot be compared directly.                        | Pointers can be compared using relational operators.      |
| **Function Arguments**   | Arrays are passed to functions by reference.               | Pointers can be passed to functions by value or reference. |
| **String Handling**      | Arrays are used to store strings in C.                     | Pointers are used to manipulate strings in C.             |
