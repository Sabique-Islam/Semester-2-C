# **Program Development Life Cycle (PDLC) in C**

## **Introduction**
The **Program Development Life Cycle (PDLC)** consists of a series of steps followed to develop a structured and efficient program. It helps ensure that the program meets the specified requirements, runs efficiently, and is free of errors.

## **Phases of PDLC**

### **1. Problem Definition**
- Understanding the problem statement.
- Identifying the input, processing, and output requirements.

### **2. Algorithm and Flowchart Design**
- Writing a step-by-step procedure (algorithm) to solve the problem.
- Creating a flowchart to visually represent the program's flow.

### **3. Coding (Implementation)**
- Writing the program using C language syntax and logic.
- Utilizing loops, functions, and data structures effectively.

### **4. Compilation and Execution**
- Translating the source code into machine code using a compiler.
- Resolving syntax errors and ensuring the code executes correctly.

### **5. Testing and Debugging**
- Checking for logical errors, runtime errors, and unexpected behaviors.
- Debugging and making necessary corrections to ensure correctness.

### **6. Documentation and Maintenance**
- Writing comments, user manuals, and documentation for clarity.
- Updating and modifying the program as needed for improvements.
